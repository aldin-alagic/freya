          'Personal information' means information or an opinion about an
          identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably
          identifiable. Freelancer's Privacy Policy applies to personal
          information collected and/or held by Freelancer. This Privacy Policy
          also explains how we process 'personal data' about people in the
          European Union (EU), as required under the General Data Protection
          Regulation (GDPR). We will review this policy regularly, and we may
          update it from time to time. The types of personal information we
          collect and hold We collect personal information about our users in
          order provide our products, services, and customer support. Our
          products, services, and customer support are provided through many
          platforms including but not limited to: websites, phone apps, email,
          and telephone. The specific platform and product, service, or support
          you interact with may affect the personal data we collect.
          <br />
          <br />
          Not all information requested, collected, and processed by us is
          "Personal Information" as it does not identify you as a specific
          natural person. This will include majority of "User Generated Content"
          that you provide us with the intention of sharing with other users.
          Such "Non-Personal Information" is not covered by this privacy policy.
          However, as non-personal information may be used in aggregate or be
          linked with existing personal information; when in this form it will
          be treated as personal information. As such, this privacy policy will
          list both types of information for the sake of transparency. In some
          situation users may provide us with personal information without us
          asking for it, or through means not intended for the collection of
          particular types of information. Whilst we may take reasonable steps
          to protect this data, the user will have bypassed our systems,
          processes, and control and thus the information provided will not be
          governed by this privacy policy. In some situations users may provide
          us personal information over platforms that are outside our control;
          for example through social media or forums. Whilst any information
          collected by us is governed by this Privacy Policy, the platform by
          which it was communicated will be governed by its own Privacy Policy.
          How we collect personal information Information that you specifically
          give us While you use our products and services you may be asked to
          provide certain types of personal information. This might happen
          through our website, applications, online chat systems, telephone,
          paper forms, or in-person meetings. We will give you a Collection
          Notice at the time, to explain how we will use the personal
          information we are asking for. The notice may be written or verbal.
